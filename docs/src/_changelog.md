# Changelog
This documents notable changes in CImGui.jl. The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## Unreleased

### Added
- [`HelpMarker()`](@ref), a port of the same function from the Dear ImGui demo
  ([#139]).

### Changed
- **Breaking**: [`render()`](@ref) would previously run on whatever task and
  thread it was called on, but with multiple threads that could cause issues if
  the task migrated. It now defaults to being pinned to thread 1 and there's a
  couple new keyword arguments, `spawn` and `wait`, to control the task pinning
  and wait behaviour ([#138]). This is technically breaking because any old code
  that set up [`render()`](@ref) to run on a specific thread by task pinning
  won't work, to get back the old behaviour pass `spawn=false`.

## [v2.3.0] - 2024-08-06

### Added
- The [Makie integration](@ref) now supports displaying rendering statistics,
  and has a context menu to change simple plot settings ([#137]). This will be
  made more customizeable in the future.

### Fixed
- Fixed a number of bugs in the Makie integration ([#137]).

### Changed
- Upon loading the Makie extension, the default Makie theme will be set to one
  that matches ImGui's default dark theme ([#137]).
- The GLFW/OpenGL renderloop will now `yield()` after every drawing iteration
  ([#137]). This makes it play a little nicer with Julia's event loop.
- **Breaking**: Previously [`MakieFigure()`](@ref) would return a `Bool` to
  indicate if the figure was rendered or not, now it returns `nothing`
  ([#137]).

  *Reminder that the [Makie integration](@ref) is not yet covered by semver.*

## [v2.2.0] - 2024-08-02

### Added
- Support for more GLMakie controls, and a tooltip for each figure by default
  ([#134]).

## [v2.1.0] - 2024-07-29

### Added
- The OpenGL version can now be set with [`render()`](@ref).
- Experimental [Makie integration](@ref) ([#133]).

## [v2.0.0] - 2024-06-27

Note: this release has particularly many breaking changes, please file an issue
or submit a pull request if something isn't working.

### Added
- A renderloop for the OpenGL/GLFW backend has been added to CImGui, so it's no
  longer necessary to copy and paste the examples around.
- The renderloop also integrates with the new
  [ImGuiTestEngine.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImGui/ImGuiTestEngine.jl) to make
  it possible to write automated tests.

### Changed
- CImGui.jl now uses semantic versioning to make development easier. This
  release is based on [Dear ImGui
  1.90.8](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.90.8).
- **Breaking**: LibCImGui.jl has been merged into `CImGui.lib`, again for the
  sake of ease of development.
- **Breaking**: The custom backends that we developed,
  [ImGuiOpenGLBackend.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImGui/ImGuiOpenGLBackend.jl)
  and [ImGuiGLFWBackend.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImGui/ImGuiGLFWBackend.jl),
  have been deprecated in favour of using ImGui's official backends. With this
  change we also dropped support for OpenGL 2, but purely out of laziness. If
  you need OpenGL 2 let us know and we can build and ship the official OpenGL 2
  backend.
- **Breaking**: The built-in renderloop is implemented using package extensions,
  which are only available on Julia 1.9+. Hence the new minimum required Julia
  version is 1.9.

### Deprecated
- `GetKeyIndex()` has been [deprecated
  upstream](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/6d948ab47ecf984239af01434f3ed03808dbf188/imgui.h#L3532). It
  will be removed in a future release.

## [v1.89.1] - 2024-05-19

### Fixed
- Fixed the implementations of [SetScrollX()](@ref) and [SetScrollY()](@ref) ([#115]).
